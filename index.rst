Porting CESM to Shaheen Documentation
=====================================

This documents our attempt to port the `Community Earth System Model
(CESM) <https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/>`_ to `Shaheen II
<https://www.hpc.kaust.edu.sa/>`_
which is a Cray XC40 at `King Abdullah University of Science and Technology
<https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en>`_.

The purpose of porting CESM is to test data assimilation algorithms using
1000-member ensembles of the `Community Atmosphere Model (CAM)
<https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/atmosphere/>`_.
